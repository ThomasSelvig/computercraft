# ComputerCraft Turtle Dashboard Design Manual

## Overview

The ComputerCraft Turtle Dashboard is a modern web application designed to monitor, control, and orchestrate multiple ComputerCraft turtles in real-time via WebSocket connections. This manual outlines the design principles, user interface components, interaction patterns, and best practices for the dashboard.

## Design Principles

1. **Real-time First**: All interactions with turtles happen in real-time, with immediate feedback.
2. **Scalable Monitoring**: The dashboard must handle monitoring and displaying status for many turtles simultaneously.
3. **Command & Control**: Provide both individual turtle control and fleet-wide orchestration capabilities.
4. **Responsive Design**: The dashboard works on various screen sizes, from desktop to tablet.
5. **Visual Clarity**: Status information and controls are presented with clear visual hierarchy and meaningful color-coding.
6. **Extensible**: The design accommodates future expansion of turtle capabilities and dashboard features.

## User Interface Components

### Header and Navigation

- **Dashboard Header**: Logo, system status indicators, global actions
- **Main Navigation**: Quick access to dashboard sections (Fleet Overview, Turtle Details, Project Manager, Program Library)
- **Global Search**: Quickly find turtles, projects, or commands

### Fleet Overview (Home Screen)

- **Turtle Fleet Summary**: Key metrics about all turtles (active count, idle count, error states)
- **Map Visualization**: Optional 3D/2D map showing turtle positions and activities
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time log of actions across all turtles
- **Quick Action Panel**: Common commands that can be broadcast to multiple turtles

### Turtle Management

- **Turtle List**: Sortable, filterable list of all turtles with key status indicators
- **Turtle Cards**: Visual representation of each turtle with status, current task, and quick actions
- **Grouping & Tagging**: Interface for organizing turtles into logical groups (by project, by type, by location)

### Individual Turtle Control

- **Turtle Details Panel**: Comprehensive view of an individual turtle's status
- **Command Interface**: Direct command input for selected turtle
- **Status Monitors**: 
  - Fuel level
  - Inventory contents
  - Current coordinates
  - Active program
  - Error states
- **Movement Controls**: Directional buttons for manual navigation
- **Inventory Management**: Visual representation of turtle inventory with action buttons

### Project & Task Orchestration

- **Project Builder**: Interface for creating multi-turtle projects
- **Task Assignment**: UI for assigning tasks to individual turtles or groups
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of project and task completion
- **Dependency Management**: Tools for establishing task sequences and dependencies

### Program Management

- **Code Editor**: Integrated editor for creating or modifying turtle programs
- **Program Library**: Collection of reusable programs/functions
- **Deployment Panel**: Interface for deploying programs to individual turtles or groups
- **Version Control**: Basic tracking of program versions and deployment history

### System Status & Logs

- **Connection Status**: Health indicators for WebSocket connections
- **Event Logs**: Filterable, searchable logs of system and turtle events
- **Performance Metrics**: Dashboard and turtle performance indicators
- **Alert Management**: Configuration for threshold-based alerts

## Interaction Patterns

### Direct Control Mode

For immediate control of individual turtles:
- Click on a turtle to select it
- Use directional controls or command input
- See immediate feedback in status panels and activity feed

### Orchestration Mode

For coordinating multiple turtles:
- Select multiple turtles (via checkboxes or group selection)
- Define tasks or load a project template
- Assign tasks and initiate execution
- Monitor progress via dashboard indicators

### Programming Mode

For creating or modifying turtle behaviors:
- Navigate to the Program Library
- Create/select a program
- Test on a specific turtle
- Deploy to target turtles when ready

## Color Scheme & Visual Language

### Status Indicators

- **Green**: Active/Operational
- **Blue**: Idle/Waiting
- **Yellow**: Warning/Low Resource
- **Red**: Error/Critical Issue
- **Gray**: Offline/Disconnected

### Action Categories

- **Movement Controls**: Blue theme
- **Interaction Actions** (dig, place): Orange theme
- **Inventory Actions**: Purple theme
- **Program Controls**: Green theme
- **System Actions**: Gray theme

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop View (Primary)

Full dashboard with all panels visible and arranged for maximum information density and control.

### Tablet View

Simplified layout with collapsible panels and focus on the most essential controls and monitoring.

### Mobile View (Limited Functionality)

Read-only monitoring with basic commands; detailed programming and orchestration reserved for larger screens.

## Accessibility Considerations

- Color choices consider color blindness, using both color and shape to convey status
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Appropriate contrast ratios for all text
- Screen reader support for critical dashboard elements

## User Workflows

### Turtle Fleet Setup

1. Add new turtles to the system
2. Apply identifying labels and group assignments
3. Deploy base programs
4. Verify connections and baseline functionality

### Building Project Workflow

1. Create new building project
2. Define building parameters or upload blueprint
3. Assign turtles to project roles
4. Initialize project and monitor progress
5. Handle exceptions and redeployments as needed

### Mining Operation Workflow

1. Select target area for mining
2. Assign turtles to mining roles
3. Deploy mining patterns/algorithms
4. Monitor resource collection and fuel levels
5. Manage inventory offloading

### System Maintenance Workflow

1. Monitor turtle health dashboard
2. Identify turtles requiring maintenance
3. Schedule refueling or inventory management
4. Deploy updates to turtle programs
5. Verify proper operation post-maintenance

## Implementation Notes

This design manual serves as a guide for development. Implementation should follow modern web development practices using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS as established in the project structure.

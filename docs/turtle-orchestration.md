# ComputerCraft Turtle Orchestration Guide

## Introduction

Turtle orchestration is the process of coordinating multiple ComputerCraft turtles to work together on large-scale projects. This guide explores orchestration patterns, strategies, and implementation approaches to maximize the efficiency and capabilities of your turtle fleet.

## Orchestration Paradigms

### 1. Centralized Control Model

In this model, the dashboard server acts as the central coordinator, making all decisions and dispatching commands to turtles in real-time.

**Advantages:**
- Complete visibility and control from the dashboard
- Easier to implement complex coordination logic
- Simpler turtle programs that primarily follow instructions

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher network overhead
- Single point of failure
- Increased latency for operations

**Best for:**
- Smaller turtle fleets
- Projects requiring precise coordination
- Situations where network reliability is high

### 2. Decentralized Control Model

Turtles operate semi-autonomously, with high-level tasks assigned by the dashboard but detailed execution handled by onboard turtle programs.

**Advantages:**
- Reduced network traffic
- Continued operation during network interruptions
- Lower latency for basic operations

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex turtle programming
- More challenging to debug
- Less real-time control from dashboard

**Best for:**
- Larger turtle fleets
- Repetitive, well-defined tasks
- Environments with potential network instability

### 3. Hybrid Control Model (Recommended)

Combines elements of both approaches: central coordination of high-level strategy with local execution of tactical operations.

**Advantages:**
- Balance of control and autonomy
- Adaptable to network conditions
- Scalable to various project sizes

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex system architecture
- Requires careful API design
- More sophisticated state management

**Best for:**
- Most production environments
- Mixed-task projects
- Growing turtle fleets

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Swarm Construction

Multiple turtles work on different sections of the same structure simultaneously.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Divide blueprint into zones
- Assign turtles to specific zones
- Coordinate material distribution
- Implement collision avoidance
- Track global progress

**Example Use Case:**
Building large structures like skyscrapers, bridges, or walls where work can be parallelized.

### 2. Mining Operations

Coordinate turtles to efficiently mine large areas with different specialized roles.

**Roles:**
- **Excavators**: Primary digging turtles
- **Transporters**: Move resources to collection points
- **Scouts**: Explore and map new areas
- **Maintenance**: Provide fuel and repairs to other turtles

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Dynamic zone assignment
- Resource collection points
- Ore prioritization algorithms
- Tunnel reinforcement protocols
- Escape route maintenance

### 3. Factory Automation

Create assembly line systems with turtles performing specialized tasks in sequence.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Fixed position assignment
- Item handoff protocols
- Production queue management
- Quality control checks
- Inventory optimization

**Example Use Case:**
Mass production of complex items requiring multiple crafting steps.

### 4. Farming Systems

Manage large-scale crop or resource farms with coordinated harvesting and replanting.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Time-based scheduling
- Growth monitoring
- Crop rotation patterns
- Weather-aware operations
- Harvest optimization

### 5. Exploration and Mapping

Deploy multiple turtles to explore and map unknown terrain efficiently.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Grid-based area assignment
- Frontier expansion algorithms
- Map data consolidation
- Point-of-interest marking
- Return path optimization

## Task Distribution Algorithms

### 1. Proximity-Based Assignment

Assign tasks to turtles closest to the work area to minimize travel time.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
function assignTasksByProximity(tasks: Task[], availableTurtles: TurtleData[]): Map<string, Task[]> {
  const assignments = new Map<string, Task[]>();
  
  // Sort tasks by priority/urgency
  const sortedTasks = [...tasks].sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority);
  
  for (const task of sortedTasks) {
    // Find closest available turtle
    const closestTurtle = availableTurtles
      .filter(t => isTurtleSuitableForTask(t, task))
      .sort((a, b) => {
        const distA = calculateDistance(a.position, task.position);
        const distB = calculateDistance(b.position, task.position);
        return distA - distB;
      })[0];
      
    if (closestTurtle) {
      // Assign task to turtle
      if (!assignments.has(closestTurtle.id)) {
        assignments.set(closestTurtle.id, []);
      }
      assignments.get(closestTurtle.id)!.push(task);
      
      // Update turtle availability based on estimated task duration
      updateTurtleAvailability(closestTurtle, task.estimatedDuration);
    } else {
      // Handle case where no suitable turtle is available
      queueTaskForLaterAssignment(task);
    }
  }
  
  return assignments;
}
```

### 2. Workload Balancing

Distribute tasks evenly across turtles to prevent overloading any single unit.

### 3. Specialization Matching

Assign tasks based on turtle equipment, programs, or historical performance.

### 4. Critical Path Prioritization

Identify tasks on the critical path of a project and prioritize their assignment.

### 5. Dynamic Reassignment

Continuously evaluate task assignments and reallocate as conditions change.

## Communication Protocols for Orchestration

### 1. Command and Status Protocol

```typescript
// Command message from server to turtle
interface CommandMessage {
  type: 'command';
  commandId: string;
  action: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  priority: number;
  timeout?: number;
}

// Status update from turtle to server
interface StatusUpdate {
  type: 'status';
  turtleId: string;
  position: Position;
  fuel: FuelStatus;
  inventory: InventoryStatus;
  currentAction?: string;
  actionProgress?: number;
  errors?: string[];
}
```

### 2. Task Assignment Protocol

```typescript
interface TaskAssignment {
  type: 'taskAssignment';
  taskId: string;
  turtleIds: string[];
  taskDefinition: {
    name: string;
    steps: TaskStep[];
    parameters: Record<string, any>;
    dependencies: string[];
    priority: number;
  };
}

interface TaskStep {
  action: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  condition?: {
    type: 'inventory' | 'position' | 'fuel' | 'custom';
    check: string;
  };
}
```

### 3. Coordination Protocol

```typescript
interface CoordinationMessage {
  type: 'coordination';
  coordinationType: 'pathfinding' | 'resourceSharing' | 'workDistribution';
  affectedTurtles: string[];
  payload: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### 4. Event Broadcasting

```typescript
interface EventBroadcast {
  type: 'event';
  eventType: string;
  source: string;
  timestamp: number;
  data: any;
  relevantTo?: string[]; // Turtle IDs this event is relevant to
}
```

  local success = true
  
  for i, step in ipairs(task.steps) do
    updateProgress(task.id, i, #task.steps)
    
    -- Check if conditions are met
    if step.condition and not checkCondition(step.condition) then
      reportIssue(task.id, "Condition failed: " .. json.encode(step.condition))
      success = false
      break
    end
    
    -- Execute the step
    local stepSuccess, error = executeStep(step)
    if not stepSuccess then
      reportIssue(task.id, "Step failed: " .. (error or "unknown error"))
      success = false
      break
    end
    
    -- Check for new instructions after each step
    local newInstructions = checkForNewInstructions()
    if newInstructions and newInstructions.type == "abort" then
      reportIssue(task.id, "Task aborted by orchestrator")
      success = false
      break
    end
  end
  
  -- Update status to completed or failed
  updateStatus(success and "completed" or "failed", task.id)
  return success
end

-- Other orchestration functions...
```

‚óè Start with an incremental approach focusing on core functionality first:

  1. Begin with the backbone:
    - First, enhance the WebSocket protocol using the spec you created
    - Update server.js to support advanced turtle tracking with proper position data
  2. Implement in phases:
    a. Phase 1: Enhanced Dashboard Basics
        - Start with the Fleet Overview page from your sitemap
      - Implement basic turtle monitoring (status, fuel, position)
      - Add basic manual controls
    b. Phase 2: Turtle Management
        - Build out the TurtleList and TurtleDetail components
      - Implement a robust status display system
      - Add individual turtle control interface
    c. Phase 3: Task System
        - Create the task definition system
      - Implement the task execution engine in the Lua code
      - Add a simple task assignment interface
    d. Phase 4: Project Orchestration
        - Build the project management framework
      - Implement multi-turtle coordination
      - Add synchronization mechanisms
  3. Development order:
    - First enhance the WebSocket server protocol in server.js
    - Then update the Lua client code to support new features
    - Finally, build the web interface components

  4. One concrete feature to start with: Advanced turtle status tracking
    - Update server.js to store comprehensive turtle data
    - Enhance the Lua code to report detailed status
    - Create a visual dashboard component to display the data

  This approach gives you a functional system at each step that you can build upon incrementally.

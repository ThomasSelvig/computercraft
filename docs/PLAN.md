# Start with an incremental approach focusing on core functionality first:

1. Implement in phases:
   a. Phase 1: Enhanced Dashboard Basics - Start with the Fleet Overview page from your sitemap

   - Implement basic turtle monitoring (status, fuel, position)
   - Add basic manual controls

   b. Phase 2: Turtle Management - Build out the TurtleList and TurtleDetail components

   - Implement a robust status display system
   - Add individual turtle control interface

   c. Phase 3: Task System - Create the task definition system

   - Implement the task execution engine in the Lua code
   - Add a simple task assignment interface

   d. Phase 4: Project Orchestration - Build the project management framework

   - Implement multi-turtle coordination
   - Add synchronization mechanisms

2. Development order:

   - First enhance the WebSocket server protocol in server.ts
   - Then update the Lua client code to support new features
   - Finally, build the web interface components

3. One concrete feature to start with: Advanced turtle status tracking

   - Update server.ts to store comprehensive turtle data
   - Enhance the Lua code to report detailed status
   - Create a visual dashboard component to display the data

This approach gives you a functional system at each step that you can build upon incrementally.

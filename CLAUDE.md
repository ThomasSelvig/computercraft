# ComputerCraft Turtle Mining Guide

## Essential Turtle Functions

### Movement & Navigation
- `moveForward()` - Forward movement with obstacle handling and path tracking
- `moveUp()` / `moveDown()` - Vertical movement with error recovery
- `turnLeft()` / `turnRight()` - Turn with reverse action tracking
- `returnHome()` - Return to starting position using recorded path

### Block Detection
- `safeInspect(direction)` - Error-resistant block inspection
- `isOre(blockName)` - Pattern-based ore detection
- `scanForOres()` - Check surroundings for valuable blocks

### Mining Logic
- `mineOreVein()` - Recursively follow and mine connected ore blocks
- `stripMine(length, branches, branchLength)` - Create branch mining pattern
- `markVisited(x, y, z)` / `isVisited(x, y, z)` - Track visited positions

### Inventory Management
- `checkInventory()` - Check for empty inventory slots
- `dropOffItems()` - Return home, empty inventory, resume mining
- `refuel()` - Smart fuel management

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Path Tracking**
   - Record the reverse of each movement to create a return path
   - Use a stack-based approach for reliable backtracking
   - Handle special cases like branch tunnels separately

2. **Error Handling**
   - Always wrap turtle API calls in pcall() for error resilience
   - Add multiple retry attempts for movement operations
   - Add sleep delays after digging to handle falling blocks

3. **Block Detection**
   - Use pattern matching instead of exact names for mod compatibility
   - Check for keywords like "ore", "gem", "crystal" for broader detection
   - Add user-configurable patterns to adapt to any modpack

4. **Inventory Management**
   - Save path state before returning home to drop items
   - Resume mining operation by retracing saved path
   - Reserve slot 1 for fuel items

5. **Mining Optimization**
   - Dig directly below for human-walkable tunnels
   - Always check inventory before starting new operations
   - Use recursive algorithms for following ore veins
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

6. **Position Tracking**
   - Use GPS when available, but don't depend on it
   - Track relative position for modpacks without GPS
   - Create unique keys for visited position tracking

7. **User Experience**
   - Add user input for customizing mining parameters
   - Display clear progress information during operation
   - Provide status updates for long-running operations

## Common Pitfalls

1. Failing to handle falling blocks (gravel, sand)
2. Not accounting for inventory filling up during mining
3. Getting stuck in recursive mining loops
4. Losing track of the return path
5. Not detecting modded ores
6. Failing to handle entities blocking movement
7. Not creating human-walkable tunnels

## Best Practices

1. Always mine blocks below for walkable tunnels
2. Add debug logging for complex operations
3. Use pattern matching for block detection
4. Implement proper path tracking and backtracking
5. Check inventory status frequently
6. Add multiple retry attempts for movement operations
7. Use sleep() after digging to let blocks settle
8. Allow for user customization of important parameters
